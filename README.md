# Iris Flower Classification Project
Overview
This project is a simple example of using machine learning to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal attributes. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset often used for introducing classification concepts in machine learning.

The project includes data visualization to explore the dataset and a trained machine learning model for classification.

Dataset
The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The following features are included:

Sepal length (in cm)
Sepal width (in cm)
Petal length (in cm)
Petal width (in cm)

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of classifying Iris flowers based on their attributes, including data visualization and machine learning model training. Feel free to explore and enhance this project for your own classification tasks.
