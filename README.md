Overview
This project is a simple example of using machine learning to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal attributes. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset often used for introducing classification concepts in machine learning.

The project includes data visualization to explore the dataset and a trained machine learning model for classification.

Dataset
The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The following features are included:

Sepal length (in cm)
Sepal width (in cm)
Petal length (in cm)
Petal width (in cm)
